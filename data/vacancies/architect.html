    <p class="pl-4">VieRally is building an AI-powered platform predicting opinion dynamics on social media to
      anticipate offline behavior and consumer opinion. We evolved from supercharging the fight
      against ideological extremism to providing actionable predictions for traders on financial
      markets. The customers in our target market love innovation, and spend over $10 billion USD
      annually on data and analytics. VieRally has proven the science behind its platform, signed up
      early customers, validated its solution with industry leaders (including Senior Vice Presidents
      at Fortune-100 companies), and secured initial funding.
